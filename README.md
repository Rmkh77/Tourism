# Tourism Recommendation System using K-Means algorithm 
The Tourism Recommendation System is an ML-based web application that leverages cutting-edge technologies such as Machine Learning, Python, and Flask functionality. Built on the Flask web framework, the system aims to simplify travel planning and exploration, catering to individual preferences and interests
The primary goal of the Tourism Recommendation System is to offer personalized travel recommendations based on user inputs and preferences.
For users interested in exploring specific places, the system offers an Explore Mode. By inputting a location name, users can access comprehensive descriptions and practical information, such as visiting time, budget recommendations, and reasons for the place's popularity. This feature allows travelers to make well-informed decisions and plan their 
itineraries efficiently.
In addition to the personalized recommendation and exploration features, the system also incorporates the Quick Recommendation tool. This enables users to receive instant travel suggestions by selecting preferred locations and categories, providing them with a list of matching destinations.
